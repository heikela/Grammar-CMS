StringField component -> Store for dispatch -> make into a container component???
MultilineTextField component -> Store for dispatch -> make into a container component???
ChoiceToMake component -> Store for dispatch -> make into a container component???

ImageField component -> cloudinary -> ???
ImageField component -> store for dispatch -> Make into a container component???
